# HTM (Hierarchical Temporal Memory) Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Research-Driven Development
Every feature and algorithm implementation begins with thorough research into HTM theory, neuroscience principles, and existing implementations. Research must be documented with clear hypotheses, experimental design, and success criteria. All theoretical foundations must be validated against current neuroscience literature and HTM theory before implementation begins.

**Rationale**: HTM is based on complex neuroscience principles that require deep understanding to implement correctly and effectively.

### II. Biologically-Inspired Architecture
All implementations must adhere to HTM's core biological principles: sparse distributed representations, temporal memory, spatial pooling, and hierarchical structure. Code architecture should mirror the biological systems being modeled, with clear separation between spatial and temporal processing components.

**Rationale**: Maintaining biological fidelity ensures the system captures the essential properties that make HTM effective for intelligence tasks.

### III. Test-Driven Scientific Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory with emphasis on scientific validation: Hypothesis → Test design → Implementation → Validation. All algorithms must have comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and behavioral validation against known HTM properties. Performance benchmarks must validate computational efficiency and biological plausibility.

**Rationale**: Scientific rigor ensures implementations are correct, reproducible, and maintain the theoretical properties of HTM.

### IV. Scalable Cloud Architecture for AI Research
All solutions must be designed for Azure deployment with focus on AI/ML workloads, high-performance computing, and research collaboration. Architecture decisions must prioritize Azure AI services, scalable compute resources, and data management for large-scale experiments. Support for distributed training and inference is required.

**Rationale**: HTM research requires significant computational resources and benefits from cloud-scale infrastructure for experimentation and collaboration.

### V. Performance & Scientific Rigor by Design
Performance optimization and scientific accuracy are equally important. All implementations must include computational complexity analysis, memory usage profiling, and biological plausibility validation. Benchmarks must compare against both artificial neural networks and biological baselines where applicable.

**Rationale**: HTM's value proposition depends on both computational efficiency and biological accuracy, requiring careful optimization and validation.

## Azure & Microsoft Technology Standards

**Technology Stack**: Prioritize .NET ecosystem for performance-critical components, Python for research and prototyping, TypeScript for web interfaces, and Azure AI/ML services for scalable deployment. Use proven Microsoft patterns for high-performance computing and machine learning workloads.

**Deployment**: All solutions deploy to Azure with emphasis on Azure Machine Learning, Azure Cognitive Services, and high-performance computing resources. Support distributed training, model versioning, and automated experiment tracking.

**Monitoring**: Implement Azure Monitor, Application Insights for performance tracking, and custom metrics for HTM-specific measurements (sparsity levels, prediction accuracy, temporal stability). All research experiments must be fully observable and reproducible.

**Documentation**: Use clear naming conventions reflecting HTM terminology, thorough scientific documentation, and maintain research notes and architectural decision records for all algorithmic choices.

## Research & Development Requirements

**Scientific Rigor**: All algorithmic implementations must reference peer-reviewed neuroscience literature and HTM theory papers. Code must include citations and theoretical justifications for design decisions.

**Reproducibility**: All experiments must be reproducible with documented parameters, random seeds, and environment specifications. Research data and experiment results must be versioned and archived.

**Collaboration**: Support for distributed research teams with shared datasets, experiment tracking, and collaborative development workflows. All research artifacts must be properly documented and accessible.

**Intellectual Property**: Ensure compliance with open-source HTM community standards while respecting Avanade's intellectual property requirements. Contributions to open-source HTM projects should be coordinated with legal and business stakeholders.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and standards for HTM research and development. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with both software engineering principles and scientific rigor requirements. Complexity that violates biological plausibility or performance requirements must be justified with documented research value and mitigation strategies.

**Amendment Process**: Constitution changes require documented rationale, scientific literature review, and approval from both technical and research stakeholders. Version increments follow semantic versioning: MAJOR for incompatible theoretical changes, MINOR for new algorithmic additions, PATCH for implementation clarifications.

**Research Review**: Regular scientific reviews ensure ongoing adherence to HTM theory and neuroscience principles. Algorithm implementations must be validated against established HTM benchmarks and biological data where available.

**Runtime Guidance**: Developers should reference `.github/prompts/` for operational guidance, `.specify/templates/` for implementation patterns, and maintain current knowledge of HTM theory through Numenta's research publications and the Thousand Brains Project documentation.
