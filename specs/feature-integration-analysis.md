# Feature Integration Analysis: HTM Pipeline Compatibility

**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Status**: Specifications Updated for Full Compatibility

## Data Flow Pipeline

```
Raw Input Data → Sensor Package → Spatial Pooler → HTM API → Processed Results
     ↓               ↓               ↓             ↓           ↓
   Any Format    Raw Encoding    Normalized     API        Processed
   Serializable   + Optional       SDRs        Processing     SDRs
    Go Types        SDRs         (2-5% sparse)   Layer      (Same Format)
```

## Updated Compatibility Matrix

| Component | Input Format | Output Format | Performance | Integration Points |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Sensor Package** | Any serializable Go type | Raw encoding + SDRs | <1ms | Outputs to Spatial Pooler |
| **Spatial Pooler** | Raw encoder output | Normalized SDRs (2-5%) | <10ms | Receives from Sensors, outputs to API |
| **HTM API** | SDRs | Processed SDRs | <100ms total | Receives from Spatial Pooler |

## Key Specification Changes Made

### 1. HTM API (Feature 001)
**Updated Requirements:**
- **FR-010**: Changed from "multi-dimensional arrays" to "Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs)"
- **FR-011**: Updated to specify "processed SDRs" for consistency
- **FR-014**: Added spatial pooler integration requirement

**Updated Entities:**
- **HTM Input**: Now explicitly SDR-based
- **Processing Result**: Clarified as processed SDRs

### 2. Sensor Package (Feature 002)
**Updated Requirements:**
- **FR-002**: Changed to output "raw encoded representations" for spatial pooler
- **FR-020**: Added dual output mode (raw + SDR)
- **FR-021**: Added spatial pooler compatibility requirement
- **FR-022**: Clarified dual output modes

**Updated Entities:**
- **Sensor Interface**: Now supports dual output
- **Raw Encoding Output**: New entity for spatial pooler input

### 3. Spatial Pooler (Feature 003)
**Resolved Clarifications:**
- Sparsity target: 2-5% (aligned with sensor standards)
- Performance target: <10ms (aligned with API requirements)

**Updated Requirements:**
- **FR-001**: Clarified raw encoder input from sensors
- **FR-010**: Specific performance target
- **FR-011**: Added API compatibility requirement

## Integration Benefits

1. **Format Consistency**: All components now use SDR as the common data format
2. **Performance Alignment**: Processing times are coordinated (1ms + 10ms + 100ms = <100ms total)
3. **Clear Responsibilities**: 
   - Sensors: Raw encoding
   - Spatial Pooler: Normalization and SDR generation
   - API: HTM processing and results
4. **Dual Mode Support**: Sensors can operate standalone or with spatial pooler
5. **Semantic Continuity**: Maintained throughout the pipeline

## Processing Flow Examples

### Example 1: Full Pipeline (Recommended)
```
Text Input → Sensor Package (text encoder) → Raw encoding → Spatial Pooler → Normalized SDR → HTM API → Processed SDR
```

### Example 2: Direct Mode (Alternative)
```
Numeric Input → Sensor Package (numeric encoder) → Direct SDR → HTM API → Processed SDR
```

## Validation Criteria

✅ **Data Format Compatibility**: All interfaces use SDR format  
✅ **Performance Requirements**: Pipeline stays under 100ms total  
✅ **Integration Points**: Clear handoffs between components  
✅ **Dual Operation**: Sensors support both pipeline and direct modes  
✅ **HTM Theory Compliance**: Spatial pooler serves as first cortical layer  

## Next Steps

1. **Planning Phase**: All three features are now ready for detailed technical planning
2. **Implementation Order**: Sensor Package → Spatial Pooler → API Integration
3. **Testing Strategy**: Integration tests to validate end-to-end pipeline
4. **Performance Validation**: Benchmark full pipeline against <100ms target

---

**Result**: All three features are now fully compatible and ready for the planning phase with clear integration points and data flow specifications.
