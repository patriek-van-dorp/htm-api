# Feature Specification: Spatial Pooler (HTM Theory) Component

**Feature Branch**: `003-spatial-pooler-htm`  
**Created**: October 1, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Spatial Pooler (HTM Theory) component should be implemented as one of the first steps when the api receives input from a sensor. The spatial pooler component acts as an encoder normalizer to ensure SDRs with consistent sparsity and semantic continuity regardless of encoder idiosyncrasies. This would be the first layer in the cortical column, which will be followed by the temporal memory component that will be defined in a later feature."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Identified: Spatial Pooler as HTM normalization layer
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: API, sensors, spatial pooler
   → Actions: normalize encoder output, ensure consistent sparsity
   → Data: SDRs (Sparse Distributed Representations)
   → Constraints: must maintain semantic continuity
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Sparsity targets: 2-5% (aligned with sensor standards)
   → Performance requirements: <10ms (aligned with API response targets)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary flow: sensor data → spatial pooler → normalized SDR
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement focuses on normalization capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities
   → SDR, SpatialPooler, normalization parameters
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Spec focuses on behavior, not implementation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system processing sensory data, I need the spatial pooler to normalize encoder outputs into consistent sparse distributed representations so that downstream temporal memory components receive standardized input patterns regardless of which specific encoder was used.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an encoder produces a dense or sparse bit pattern, **When** the spatial pooler processes this input, **Then** the output must be a sparse distributed representation with consistent sparsity levels
2. **Given** two semantically similar inputs from different encoders, **When** processed by the spatial pooler, **Then** the resulting SDRs should have overlapping active bits indicating semantic similarity
3. **Given** a noisy or corrupted encoder output, **When** the spatial pooler processes it, **Then** the resulting SDR should be stable and similar to the clean version of the same input
4. **Given** completely different input patterns, **When** processed by the spatial pooler, **Then** the resulting SDRs should have minimal overlap in active bits
5. **Given** raw encoder output from sensor components, **When** processed by the spatial pooler, **Then** the output SDRs are compatible with HTM API input requirements
6. **Given** spatial pooler processing completes, **When** SDRs are passed to the API, **Then** the end-to-end pipeline maintains performance under 100ms total response time

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: When the spatial pooler encounters invalid encoder outputs (all zeros, all ones, or corrupted data), what should the system behavior be? → A: Generate a default/fallback SDR pattern
- Q: What is the expected maximum throughput (requests per second) the spatial pooler should handle? → A: 1,000-5,000 requests/second (medium volume)
- Q: How should the spatial pooler handle inputs that exceed the expected input dimensions? → A: Reject with error message
- Q: Should identical inputs always produce identical SDRs, or should there be controlled randomness for learning purposes? → A: User-configurable deterministic/random mode
- Q: What specific input format constraints should the spatial pooler enforce from sensor encoders? → A: Array of bytes

### Edge Cases
- When encoder output is all zeros, all ones, or corrupted, the system generates a default/fallback SDR pattern to maintain pipeline continuity
- When encoder outputs exceed expected input dimensions, the system rejects the input with an error message
- Identical inputs produce identical SDRs in deterministic mode or controlled variations in randomness mode based on user configuration

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept raw encoder output from sensor components as input to the spatial pooler component in array of bytes format
- **FR-002**: System MUST produce sparse distributed representations with 2-5% sparsity levels (consistent with sensor package standards)
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain semantic continuity where similar inputs produce overlapping SDR patterns with 30-70% bit overlap, while different inputs have <20% overlap
- **FR-004**: System MUST normalize encoder outputs to eliminate encoder-specific biases and inconsistencies
- **FR-005**: System MUST be the first processing layer in the cortical column before temporal memory
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle varying input sizes and formats from different encoder types within expected dimensional limits
- **FR-014**: System MUST reject encoder inputs that exceed expected input dimensions with clear error messages
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide configurable deterministic or randomness modes where identical inputs produce identical SDRs (deterministic) or controlled variations (randomness mode)
- **FR-008**: System MUST distinguish between genuinely different inputs by producing SDRs with low overlap (<20% bit overlap)
- **FR-009**: System MUST adapt over time to maintain balanced representation usage across all columns (column usage variance <2 standard deviations from mean)
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide processing performance under 10ms to maintain overall API response time targets under 100ms
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle throughput of 1,000-5,000 requests per second under normal operating conditions
- **FR-012**: System MUST generate a default/fallback SDR pattern when encountering invalid encoder outputs (all zeros, all ones, or corrupted data) to maintain processing pipeline continuity
- **FR-011**: System MUST output SDRs compatible with HTM API input requirements for seamless integration

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **SpatialPooler**: Core component that transforms raw encoder outputs into normalized SDRs with consistent sparsity and semantic properties, compatible with HTM API inputs
- **SDR (Sparse Distributed Representation)**: Output format with 2-5% sparsity level and semantic continuity properties, standardized for HTM API consumption
- **EncoderInput**: Raw input from sensor package encoding operations in array of bytes format that require normalization before HTM processing
- **PoolingParameters**: Configuration settings that control sparsity levels, learning rates, adaptation behavior, and deterministic/randomness mode to maintain consistency across different encoder types
- **SemanticSimilarity**: Measure of how much overlap exists between SDRs representing similar concepts (30-70% bit overlap for similar inputs, <20% for different inputs), maintained through normalization process
