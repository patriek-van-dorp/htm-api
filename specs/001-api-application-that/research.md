# Research: HTM Neural Network API Core

**Feature**: 001-api-application-that  
**Date**: September 30, 2025  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Objectives
Resolve technical decisions for implementing a Go-based HTTP API that processes multi-dimensional arrays for HTM neural network inputs, with emphasis on performance, scalability, and matrix computation efficiency.

## Key Decisions

### Decision: Go Language & Framework Selection
**Rationale**: 
- Go provides excellent concurrent request handling with goroutines
- Strong HTTP server performance and low latency characteristics
- gonum library offers numpy-like matrix operations in Go ecosystem
- Static typing ensures robust API contract validation
- Simple deployment model aligns with scalability requirements

**Framework Choice**: Gin HTTP framework
- Lightweight with minimal overhead for <100ms response requirement
- Built-in JSON binding and validation support
- Extensive middleware ecosystem
- Well-documented and widely adopted

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Echo framework: Similar performance, chose Gin for broader ecosystem
- Standard library net/http: More verbose, Gin provides productivity benefits
- Fiber framework: Good performance but less mature than Gin

### Decision: Matrix Library - gonum
**Rationale**:
- Direct replacement for numpy with similar API patterns
- Optimized linear algebra operations (BLAS/LAPACK integration)
- Native Go implementation eliminates FFI overhead
- Supports multi-dimensional arrays and matrix operations required for HTM
- Active development and good documentation

**Key capabilities**:
- Dense and sparse matrix representations
- Element-wise operations and broadcasting
- Linear algebra routines optimized for performance
- Compatible with Go's type system for compile-time safety

**Alternatives considered**:
- Gorgonia: More ML-focused, heavier than needed for matrix operations
- Custom implementation: Too complex for initial API, gonum proven solution

### Decision: API Design Pattern - REST with JSON
**Rationale**:
- RESTful design supports API chaining requirements
- JSON format handles multi-dimensional arrays efficiently
- Standard HTTP methods align with simple API requirements
- Easy integration with monitoring and testing tools

**Input Format**:
```json
{
  "data": [[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]],
  "metadata": {
    "dimensions": [2, 2],
    "timestamp": "2025-09-30T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Output Format**:
```json
{
  "result": [[1.1, 2.1], [3.1, 4.1]],
  "metadata": {
    "dimensions": [2, 2],
    "processing_time_ms": 45,
    "instance_id": "api-001"
  }
}
```

**Alternatives considered**:
- gRPC: Better performance but adds complexity, HTTP sufficient for requirements
- GraphQL: Overkill for simple input/output API
- Binary formats: More efficient but reduces API simplicity

### Decision: Concurrent Processing Architecture
**Rationale**:
- Go's goroutine model naturally supports concurrent request handling
- Channel-based worker pools for matrix processing
- Stateless design enables horizontal scaling
- Per-request context for timeout and cancellation

**Processing Flow**:
1. HTTP handler receives request (immediate acknowledgment)
2. Input validation and parsing
3. Matrix processing via worker pool
4. Response with results or async job ID for long operations

**Scaling Strategy**:
- Multiple API instances behind load balancer
- Each instance handles different sensor inputs
- Shared-nothing architecture for clean scaling

### Decision: Error Handling & Retry Strategy
**Rationale**:
- Exponential backoff for transient failures aligns with spec requirements
- Structured error responses support client debugging
- Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascade failures

**Implementation**:
- Retry logic in processing layer
- Timeout handling via Go context
- Structured error responses with error codes and descriptions

### Decision: Testing Strategy
**Rationale**:
- Table-driven tests for matrix operations (Go idiom)
- HTTP test servers for API contract validation
- Benchmark tests for performance validation
- Property-based testing for matrix operation correctness

**Test Structure**:
- Unit tests: Matrix operations, handlers, validation
- Integration tests: Full HTTP request/response cycles
- Contract tests: OpenAPI schema validation
- Performance tests: Latency and throughput benchmarks

### Decision: Configuration & Deployment
**Rationale**:
- 12-factor app principles for cloud deployment
- Environment-based configuration
- Docker containerization for Azure deployment
- Health check endpoints for load balancer integration

**Configuration Areas**:
- Server settings (port, timeouts, worker pool size)
- Processing settings (matrix operation limits, retry configuration)
- Monitoring settings (metrics collection, logging levels)

## HTM-Specific Considerations

### Future HTM Integration Points
**Research Finding**: API design must accommodate future HTM algorithm integration
- Input format supports spatial-temporal patterns
- Processing pipeline designed for pluggable algorithms
- Matrix operations optimized for sparse representations (common in HTM)

### Biological Plausibility
**Research Finding**: gonum supports operations that align with HTM principles
- Sparse matrix operations for SDR (Sparse Distributed Representations)
- Temporal sequence processing capabilities
- Flexible data structures for hierarchical computations

### Performance Characteristics
**Research Finding**: Matrix operation performance critical for HTM viability
- gonum BLAS integration provides optimized linear algebra
- Go's garbage collector tuned for low-latency applications
- Concurrent processing aligns with parallel HTM column processing

## Implementation Priorities
1. **Phase 1**: Basic API structure with input validation
2. **Phase 2**: Matrix processing with gonum integration
3. **Phase 3**: Concurrent request handling and worker pools
4. **Phase 4**: Error handling and retry logic
5. **Phase 5**: Performance optimization and monitoring

## Open Questions Resolved
- ✅ Multi-dimensional array handling: gonum mat package
- ✅ HTTP framework selection: Gin for performance and simplicity
- ✅ Concurrent processing: goroutine worker pools
- ✅ API response format: JSON with consistent structure
- ✅ Testing approach: Standard Go testing with testify helpers
