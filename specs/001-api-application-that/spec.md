# Feature Specification: HTM Neural Network API Core

**Feature Branch**: `001-api-application-that`  
**Created**: September 30, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "API application that will receive inputs for the neural network (based on HTM theory) that will be the core of the business logical that will be added in later features. The API should be simple, fast and scalable. For now, it does not require any authentication, but this will be a future feature."

```
1. Parse user description from Input

   ‚Üí Constraints: simple, fast, scalable, no authentication initially
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific input data format and structure for HTM neural network]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: expected response format and processing results]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance requirements - what constitutes "fast" and "scalable"]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what types of inputs does the HTM neural network expect]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: external system sends HTM input data, receives processed response
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí API must accept HTM neural network inputs
   ‚Üí API must process inputs and return results
   ‚Üí API must handle concurrent requests (scalability)

6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí HTM Input: data structure for neural network processing
   ‚Üí Processing Result: output from HTM neural network computation
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - several clarifications needed"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with noted clarifications)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: What specific data format will the HTM neural network API accept as input? ‚Üí A: Multi-dimensional arrays representing spatial-temporal patterns
- Q: What should the API return as output from HTM neural network processing? ‚Üí A: Multi-dimensional arrays (same format as input) for API chaining
- Q: What are the target performance requirements for "fast" API response times? ‚Üí A: Under 100ms for real-time applications
- Q: What scalability target should the system support for concurrent requests? ‚Üí A: Multiple instances for different sensors
- Q: How should the API handle errors when HTM processing fails or times out? ‚Üí A: Retry processing automatically with exponential backoff

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an external system or application, I need to send input data to the HTM neural network API so that I can receive processed results from the HTM-based computation engine, enabling me to integrate neural network capabilities into my application.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the API is running and available, **When** I send a valid HTM input payload to the API endpoint, **Then** I receive a successful response with the processed neural network results
2. **Given** multiple API instances are running, **When** different sensors send concurrent requests to their respective instances, **Then** all requests are processed independently without interference
3. **Given** I send an invalid input format, **When** the API processes the request, **Then** I receive a clear error message indicating what was wrong with the input
4. **Given** the HTM neural network processing completes, **When** I receive the response, **Then** the API acknowledges my request within 100ms and provides asynchronous access to results

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the input data is malformed or doesn't match the expected multi-dimensional array format?
- How does the system handle extremely large input payloads that might exceed processing capacity?
- What occurs when the HTM neural network processing fails repeatedly despite automatic retry with exponential backoff?
- How does the system behave when multiple sensor instances experience failures simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept input data for HTM neural network processing via API endpoints
- **FR-002**: System MUST process HTM neural network inputs and return computation results
- **FR-003**: System MUST handle multiple concurrent requests without blocking
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate input data format before processing
- **FR-005**: System MUST return appropriate error messages for invalid inputs
- **FR-013**: System MUST enable API chaining by maintaining consistent input/output format across instances
- **FR-012**: System MUST retry failed HTM processing automatically with exponential backoff
- **FR-006**: System MUST respond within 100ms for API acknowledgment (asynchronous processing for longer HTM computations)
- **FR-007**: System MUST support horizontal scaling with multiple instances handling different sensor inputs
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide consistent API interface for future feature integration
- **FR-009**: System MUST NOT require authentication for current implementation (future feature)
- **FR-010**: System MUST accept Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs) as input format for HTM neural network processing, compatible with sensor package outputs and spatial pooler components
- **FR-011**: System MUST return processed SDRs (same format as input) to enable API chaining and spatial pooler integration
- **FR-014**: System MUST integrate with spatial pooler component as the first processing layer in the cortical column before other HTM neural network operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **HTM Input**: Represents Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs) containing spatial-temporal pattern data required for HTM neural network processing, compatible with sensor outputs and spatial pooler components
- **Processing Result**: Represents the output containing processed SDRs (same format as input) from HTM neural network computation, enabling API chaining and integration with cortical column components
- **API Request**: Represents an incoming request containing HTM input data and any metadata required for processing
- **API Response**: Represents the response containing either successful processing results or error information
