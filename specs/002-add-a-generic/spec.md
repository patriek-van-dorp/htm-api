# Feature Specification: Generic HTM Sensor Package

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-a-generic`  
**Created**: October 1, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add a generic sensor package that takes any input and outputs a Sparsely Distributed Representation (SDR). Make the library (or package) so that it is easy to inject custom logic for different types of sensors, so that the sensor library is easily adaptable for different scenarios. Base this all on Hierarchical Temporal Memory theory or The Thousand Brains Project from Numenta and ensure it is based on neurobiological evidence of how our brain works."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input

   ‚Üí Constraints: HTM/Thousand Brains theory compliance, neurobiological evidence
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Input types and formats specified below
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Developer integration scenarios defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (data structures)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All items addressed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: What are the target performance requirements for encoding operations? ‚Üí A: Sub-millisecond (<1ms) for high-frequency trading/control systems
- Q: What are the constraints on acceptable input data formats? ‚Üí A: Any serializable Go type that can be converted to bytes
- Q: What are the concurrency requirements for sensor operations? ‚Üí A: Single-threaded only - no concurrent access support needed
- Q: How should the system behave when encoding operations fail? ‚Üí A: Silent failure - return empty/default SDR when encoding fails
- Q: What are the constraints on input data volume per encoding operation? ‚Üí A: Medium data - documents, small images (<1MB)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer building HTM-based applications, I need a generic sensor package that can convert any type of input data into Sparsely Distributed Representations (SDRs) so that I can feed consistent data representations into HTM algorithms without having to implement sensor logic from scratch for each data type.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer has numeric data, **When** they configure the sensor package for numeric encoding, **Then** the system outputs a valid SDR representation with configurable sparsity levels
2. **Given** a developer has text data, **When** they inject custom tokenization logic, **Then** the system processes the text and produces semantically meaningful SDRs
3. **Given** a developer has image data, **When** they configure spatial encoding parameters, **Then** the system converts pixel data into spatial SDRs suitable for HTM processing
4. **Given** a developer wants to create a new sensor type, **When** they implement the sensor interface, **Then** the system seamlessly integrates the custom sensor without modifying core package code
5. **Given** multiple sensor types are active, **When** data flows through the system, **Then** all sensors produce SDRs with consistent dimensionality and sparsity characteristics

### Edge Cases
- What happens when input data contains null or invalid values? ‚Üí System returns empty SDR
- How does the system handle extremely large or small numeric ranges that could affect encoding quality? ‚Üí System returns empty SDR for out-of-range values
- What occurs when custom sensor logic fails or produces invalid SDRs? ‚Üí System returns empty SDR as fallback
- How does the system maintain encoding consistency when sensor parameters change? ‚Üí Configuration changes require sensor re-instantiation

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept any serializable Go type (convertible to bytes) through a generic interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST output raw encoded representations that can be processed by spatial pooler components before final SDR generation
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide both raw encoding output for spatial pooler integration and direct SDR output for standalone operation
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow developers to inject custom encoding logic for specific data types
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide built-in encoders for common data types (numeric, categorical, text, spatial)
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain configurable sparsity levels (typically 2-5% active bits)
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure SDR consistency - same input produces same SDR representation
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate that output SDRs meet HTM theoretical requirements (sparse, distributed, binary)
- **FR-008**: System MUST support batch processing of multiple inputs
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow configuration of SDR dimensions and encoding parameters
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide semantic similarity preservation in SDR space for similar inputs with measurable criteria: similar inputs (‚â•80% content similarity) must produce SDRs with ‚â•60% bit overlap, and dissimilar inputs (<20% content similarity) must produce SDRs with ‚â§10% bit overlap
- **FR-011**: System MUST implement encoding strategies based on neurobiological principles from cortical columns

- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain encoding robustness against noise in input data with measurable tolerance: up to 10% random noise in numeric inputs, up to 5% character errors in text inputs, and up to 15% pixel noise in spatial inputs while maintaining ‚â•90% SDR stability (‚â§10% active bit changes)
- **FR-016**: System MUST operate in single-threaded mode with no concurrent access support required
- **FR-017**: System MUST return empty/default SDR when encoding operations fail (silent failure mode)
- **FR-018**: System MUST support input data volumes up to 1MB per encoding operation (medium data constraint)
- **FR-019**: System MUST support multi-SDR collections for spatial subdivision and complex data structures
