# Research: Generic HTM Sensor Package

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. HTM Theory and Neurobiological Foundations

**Decision**: Implement sensors based on HTM cortical column theory with sparse distributed representations
**Rationale**: 
- HTM theory is grounded in neuroscience research on cortical column structure and function
- Sparse distributed representations (SDRs) provide robust, noise-tolerant encoding
- Biological fidelity ensures the system captures essential properties of human intelligence
- Numenta's research provides validated algorithms and performance characteristics

**Alternatives considered**:
- Dense vector representations: Rejected due to lack of biological plausibility and poor noise tolerance
- Traditional feature extraction: Rejected due to loss of temporal and spatial context
- Neural embedding models: Rejected due to lack of interpretability and biological grounding

**Key Principles**:
- Sparsity: 2-5% active bits in SDR representations
- Distributed representation: Semantic similarity preserved in overlap patterns
- Binary activation: Biologically realistic on/off neuron states
- Topology preservation: Spatial relationships maintained in encoding

### 2. Go Implementation Best Practices for Scientific Computing

**Decision**: Use Go interfaces for extensibility, gonum for matrix operations, and property-based testing
**Rationale**:
- Go's interface system provides clean abstraction without runtime overhead
- Gonum offers mature, optimized matrix operations needed for SDR calculations
- Property-based testing validates algorithmic correctness across input ranges
- Go's simplicity aligns with self-documenting code requirements

**Alternatives considered**:
- CGO bindings to C/C++ libraries: Rejected due to deployment complexity and maintenance burden
- Pure Go matrix operations: Rejected due to performance implications for large SDRs
- Reflection-based generics: Rejected due to runtime overhead and complexity

**Key Patterns**:
- Interface-first design for sensor contracts
- Immutable SDR types for thread safety
- Builder pattern for complex configuration
- Functional options for API flexibility

### 3. SDR Encoding Strategies for Different Data Types

**Decision**: Implement specialized encoders with consistent output format but type-specific logic
**Rationale**:
- Numeric encoding: Scalar encoder with configurable resolution and range
- Categorical encoding: One-hot with collision handling for large vocabularies
- Text encoding: Token-based with semantic similarity preservation
- Spatial encoding: Grid-based for topology preservation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Universal hash-based encoding: Rejected due to loss of semantic relationships
- Learned embeddings: Rejected due to training requirements and biological implausibility
- Random projection: Rejected due to lack of consistency guarantees

**Encoding Parameters**:
- SDR width: Configurable, typically 1000-2048 bits
- Sparsity: 2-5% active bits (20-100 bits for 2048-bit SDR)
- Resolution: Configurable precision for numeric values
- Semantic distance: Preserved through overlap calculations

### 4. Performance Requirements and Optimization Strategies (Updated with Clarifications)

**Decision**: Target sub-millisecond encoding time with memory-efficient SDR operations for high-frequency systems
**Rationale**:
- **Clarification Applied**: Sub-millisecond latency requirement for high-frequency trading and control systems
- Real-time applications in financial and control domains require extreme low latency
- Memory pooling reduces GC pressure for high-throughput scenarios
- Bit manipulation operations optimize sparse representation handling
- Single-threaded operation eliminates synchronization overhead

**Alternatives considered**:
- Lazy evaluation: Rejected due to unpredictable latency in high-frequency scenarios
- Concurrent processing: Rejected based on clarification - single-threaded operation preferred
- SIMD optimization: Considered for future enhancement but not required for initial targets

**Optimization Techniques** (Updated):
- Bit vectors for sparse representation storage
- Memory pools for frequent allocations (single-threaded only)
- Pre-allocated buffers for 1MB input processing
- Benchmark-driven optimization with sub-millisecond validation
- Silent failure modes to avoid exception handling overhead

### 5. Validation and Testing Strategies (Updated with Clarifications)

**Decision**: Multi-layered testing with performance benchmarks, silent failure validation, and single-threaded operation
**Rationale**:
- **Clarification Applied**: Silent failure mode requires specific error handling validation
- **Clarification Applied**: Single-threaded operation simplifies testing and eliminates race conditions
- **Clarification Applied**: Sub-millisecond performance targets require dedicated benchmark tests
- Contract tests ensure interface compliance
- Property-based tests validate algorithmic correctness across input space
- Biological validation ensures HTM theoretical compliance

**Testing Approaches** (Updated):
- Interface contract validation (single-threaded focus)
- SDR property verification (sparsity, distribution, consistency)
- Silent failure behavior validation (empty SDR on errors)
- Sub-millisecond performance benchmarking per encoder
- Input size limit testing (1MB constraint validation)
- Sequential multi-sensor integration testing
- Semantic similarity preservation tests

### 6. Documentation and Learning Requirements

**Decision**: Comprehensive documentation with HTM theory explanations and usage examples
**Rationale**:
- HTM concepts require neuroscience background explanation
- Code examples demonstrate proper usage patterns
- API documentation enables independent learning
- Theory references support research validation

**Documentation Structure**:
- Package-level overview with HTM theory introduction
- Interface documentation with biological analogies
- Implementation guides for custom sensors
- Performance characteristics and tuning guidance
- References to neuroscience literature and HTM papers
