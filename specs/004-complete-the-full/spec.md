## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: What are the expected response time requirements for spatial pooler processing requests? ‚Üí A: Under 100ms for real-time interactive use
- Q: What is the maximum expected input data size for a single spatial pooler processing request? ‚Üí A: Large datasets (under 10MB, ~1M-10M data points)
- Q: How should the system behave when invalid input data or configuration parameters are provided? ‚Üí A: Log error and return generic failure response
- Q: What is the maximum number of concurrent spatial pooler processing requests the system should support? ‚Üí A: Medium concurrency (10-100 concurrent requests)
- Q: What specific scope should "deterministic behavior" cover for reproducible results? ‚Üí A: Same input + same config = functionally equivalent output (may vary slightly)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a data scientist or researcher using the HTM system, I need a fully functional spatial pooler that can process input data through the complete HTM algorithm pipeline, so that I can perform hierarchical temporal memory analysis on real-world datasets and validate the system's behavior through comprehensive testing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an HTM system with input data, **When** I submit data for spatial pooling processing, **Then** the system successfully processes the data through the complete spatial pooler algorithm and returns meaningful sparse distributed representations
2. **Given** a complete spatial pooler implementation, **When** I run the existing TDD test suite, **Then** all tests pass and validate the correct implementation of spatial pooling behaviors
3. **Given** the integrated system, **When** I configure spatial pooler parameters, **Then** the system applies those parameters correctly during processing and produces deterministic results
4. **Given** multiple concurrent requests, **When** I process data through the spatial pooler, **Then** the system handles all requests correctly without interference or data corruption

### Edge Cases
- What happens when input data exceeds expected dimensions or contains invalid values? ‚Üí System logs error and returns standardized error response with code "INVALID_INPUT_DATA" and specific validation details
- How does the system handle spatial pooler configuration errors or invalid parameters? ‚Üí System logs error and returns standardized error response with code "INVALID_CONFIGURATION" and parameter validation details
- What occurs when the system runs out of memory during large-scale spatial pooling operations? ‚Üí System logs error and returns standardized error response with code "MEMORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED" and resource guidance
- How does the system behave when processing extremely sparse or dense input patterns? ‚Üí System handles sparse patterns (<0.5% sparsity) and dense patterns (>10% sparsity) by applying normalization or returning validation error with code "SPARSITY_OUT_OF_RANGE"

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement a complete spatial pooler engine that performs all core HTM spatial pooling operations including inhibition, learning, and sparse representation generation
- **FR-002**: System MUST integrate the spatial pooler engine with existing HTTP endpoints to enable end-to-end data processing through the API
- **FR-003**: System MUST wire all components together in the main application entry point to create a fully functional HTM processing system
- **FR-004**: System MUST enable all existing TDD tests to execute against the actual implementation rather than mock implementations
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain functionally equivalent output for identical inputs and configuration parameters to ensure reproducible results (slight variations acceptable)
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle spatial pooler configuration parameters correctly, applying them during processing operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST process input data through the complete spatial pooling algorithm to generate accurate sparse distributed representations
- **FR-008**: System MUST support concurrent processing requests without data corruption or interference between operations
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate input data and configuration parameters before processing to prevent system errors
- **FR-010**: System MUST log validation errors and return standardized error responses with specific error codes (INVALID_INPUT_DATA, INVALID_CONFIGURATION, MEMORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED, SPARSITY_OUT_OF_RANGE) for invalid inputs or system failures during spatial pooling operations
- **FR-011**: System MUST respond to spatial pooler processing requests within 100ms for real-time interactive use
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle input datasets up to 10MB in size containing up to 10 million data points per processing request
- **FR-013**: System MUST support up to 100 concurrent spatial pooler processing requests without performance degradation
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle input patterns with sparsity outside normal range (sparse <0.5%, dense >10%) by applying normalization or returning validation errors with appropriate error codes

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Spatial Pooler Engine**: The core HTM spatial pooling algorithm implementation that processes input patterns and generates sparse distributed representations
- **HTM Processing Pipeline**: The complete data flow from input reception through spatial pooling to output generation
- **Configuration Parameters**: Settings that control spatial pooler behavior including learning rates, inhibition parameters, and sparsity levels
- **Sparse Distributed Representations**: The output patterns generated by the spatial pooler that encode input information in sparse binary format
- **Test Infrastructure**: The comprehensive test suite that validates all aspects of spatial pooler functionality and system integration
