# Tasks: Complete HTM Pipeline with Sensor-to-Motor Integration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-implementation-readme-is/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✓), research.md (✓), data-model.md (✓), contracts/ (✓), quickstart.md (✓)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: Go 1.23+, gonum, Gin framework, testify, go-playground/validator
   → Structure: Single project - HTM API service with clean architecture
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: 12 entities identified → model tasks
   → contracts/: 4 API files → contract test tasks  
   → research.md: HTM algorithm decisions → setup tasks
   → quickstart.md: Test scenarios → integration tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Go dependencies, HTM compliance tooling
   → Tests: 15 contract tests, 8 integration tests
   → Core: 12 models, 4 services, 3 handlers
   → Integration: API routing, pipeline orchestration
   → Sample Client: 4 sensor types, client application
   → Polish: unit tests, performance benchmarks, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Contract tests [P] - different files
   → Entity models [P] - different files  
   → Handlers sequential - same router file
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T087)
6. Dependencies: Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Handlers → Integration → Client → Polish
7. Validate: All contracts tested, all entities modeled, TDD enforced
8. SUCCESS: 87 tasks ready for execution
```

## HTM-Specific Validation Requirements

### Biological Constraint Validation
All tasks implementing HTM algorithms must validate:
- **Sparsity**: 2-5% active cells/columns throughout pipeline
- **Temporal Continuity**: Sequence learning maintains biological plausibility  
- **Synaptic Limits**: Cell connections within biological bounds
- **Learning Rates**: Synaptic plasticity follows HTM theory
- **Motor Output Alignment**: Action generation maintains prediction confidence thresholds consistent with HTM biological timing constraints

### Performance Requirements
All implementation tasks must meet:
- **End-to-end Latency**: <100ms sensor-to-motor processing
- **Concurrent Sensors**: Support 25 simultaneous sensor inputs
- **Memory Efficiency**: <500MB total pipeline memory usage
- **HTM Compliance**: Maintain biological constraints under load

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Contract Tests**: 100% endpoint coverage with failure scenarios
- **Integration Tests**: Complete pipeline scenarios with all sensor types
- **Unit Tests**: Algorithm-level testing with HTM compliance validation
- **Performance Tests**: Latency, throughput, and resource usage benchmarks

## Notes
- **[P] tasks**: Different files, can execute in parallel
- **Sequential tasks**: Same file modifications, must execute in order
- **TDD Enforcement**: All T005-T027 must fail before implementation begins
- **HTM Compliance**: Every algorithm implementation must include biological validation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Benchmark every major component for <100ms target
- **Sample Client**: Demonstrates complete pipeline with real sensor data
- **Commit Strategy**: Commit after each completed task for incremental progress

## Task Validation Checklist
✅ All contracts (4 API files) have corresponding contract tests  
✅ All entities (15 main entities) have model creation tasks  
✅ All contract tests come before implementation (T005-T027 → T028+)  
✅ Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files)  
✅ Each task specifies exact file path  
✅ No [P] task modifies same file as another [P] task  
✅ HTM biological constraints validated throughout  
✅ Sample client demonstrates complete sensor-to-motor pipeline  
✅ Performance requirements (<100ms) enforced in benchmarks
