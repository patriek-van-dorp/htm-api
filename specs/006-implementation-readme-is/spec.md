## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an HTM researcher or developer, I want to test the complete cortical processing pipeline from sensor input to motor output, so that I can validate HTM algorithms work correctly in a realistic environment with actual sensor data flowing through all processing stages.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a sensor generates raw data (temperature, image, text), **When** the sensor sends data to the HTM API, **Then** the data flows through encoding ‚Üí spatial pooler ‚Üí temporal memory ‚Üí motor output with proper biological constraints maintained at each stage

2. **Given** a sample client application with embedded sensors, **When** the client runs automated tests, **Then** all HTM processing stages respond correctly and produce expected outputs for known input patterns

3. **Given** multiple sensor types are active simultaneously, **When** they send data to the HTM pipeline, **Then** each sensor's data is processed independently while maintaining consistent sparsity and temporal patterns

4. **Given** the spatial pooler produces HTM-compliant SDRs, **When** temporal memory processes these SDRs, **Then** sequence learning and prediction occur correctly without violating biological constraints

5. **Given** temporal memory generates predictions, **When** motor output processes these predictions, **Then** appropriate actions are generated that correspond to the input patterns and learned sequences

### Edge Cases
- What happens when sensor data is corrupted or outside expected ranges?
- How does the system handle network failures between sensor client and HTM API?
- What occurs when multiple sensors send conflicting or contradictory data?
- How does the system behave when temporal memory predictions have low confidence?
- What happens when motor output actions cannot be executed due to physical constraints?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement the complete HTM pipeline as documented in README.md (sensors ‚Üí encoders ‚Üí spatial pooler ‚Üí temporal memory ‚Üí motor output)
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide API endpoints for each stage of HTM processing (encoding, spatial pooling, temporal memory, motor output)
- **FR-003**: Sensors MUST be able to connect directly to the HTM API without requiring manual SDR construction
- **FR-004**: System MUST include multiple sensor types for comprehensive testing (temperature, text, image, and audio sensors for complete sensory coverage)
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a sample client application that demonstrates complete sensor-to-motor pipeline operation
- **FR-006**: Spatial pooler MUST produce HTM-compliant SDRs that feed directly into temporal memory processing
- **FR-007**: Temporal memory MUST learn sequences from spatial pooler SDRs and generate predictions
- **FR-008**: Motor output MUST convert temporal memory predictions into actionable responses (movement, audio, visual, and control actions for complete actuator coverage)
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain biological constraints (2-5% sparsity, proper temporal patterns) throughout the entire pipeline
- **FR-010**: Sample client MUST demonstrate real-time sensor data processing through all HTM stages
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide monitoring and debugging capabilities for each pipeline stage
- **FR-012**: API MUST handle concurrent requests from up to 25 sensors simultaneously without performance degradation
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate that encoder outputs are compatible with spatial pooler input requirements
- **FR-014**: Motor output MUST provide feedback mechanisms to validate action execution (success confirmation, error reporting, sensor feedback loops, and performance metrics for complete validation suite)
- **FR-015**: Sample client MUST include automated test scenarios for validating HTM pipeline correctness
- **FR-016**: System MUST process complete sensor-to-motor pipeline within 100ms for interactive application performance

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Sensor**: Generates raw data (temperature values, images, text, etc.) and transmits to HTM API
- **Encoder**: Converts raw sensor data into bit patterns suitable for spatial pooler processing
- **Spatial Pooler**: Transforms encoder outputs into HTM-compliant sparse distributed representations
- **Temporal Memory**: Learns sequences from spatial pooler SDRs and generates predictions about future inputs
- **Motor Output**: Converts temporal memory predictions into actionable commands or responses
- **HTM Pipeline**: Complete data flow from sensor input to motor action, maintaining biological constraints
- **Sample Client Application**: Demonstration application hosting sensors and testing complete HTM functionality
- **API Gateway**: Manages communication between sensors and HTM processing stages
- **SDR (Sparse Distributed Representation)**: Core data structure passed between HTM processing stages
- **Processing Stage Metrics**: Performance and health monitoring data for each pipeline component
