# Implementation Plan: Complete HTM Pipeline with Sensor-to-Motor Integration

**Branch**: `006-implementation-readme-is` | **Date**: October 2, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/006-implementation-readme-is/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implement a complete HTM pipeline that enables sensor-to-motor integration by enhancing the existing HTM API to support direct sensor connections, implementing all processing stages (encoders → spatial pooler → temporal memory → motor output), and providing a sample client application for comprehensive testing. The system must maintain HTM biological constraints while processing real-time sensor data through the complete cortical processing pipeline.

**Primary Dependencies**: gonum (matrix calculations), Gin framework (HTTP), testify (testing), go-playground/validator (validation)  
**Storage**: In-memory processing, no persistent storage required for HTM pipeline operations  
**Testing**: testify with comprehensive contract, integration, and unit test suites  
**Target Platform**: Linux server, containerized deployment  
**Project Type**: Single project - HTM API service with clean architecture  
**Performance Goals**: <100ms end-to-end sensor-to-motor pipeline processing, handle up to 25 concurrent sensors  
**Constraints**: <10MB input datasets, maintain 2-5% HTM sparsity throughout pipeline, biologically-inspired architecture  
**Scale/Scope**: Complete HTM pipeline (sensors → encoders → spatial pooler → temporal memory → motor output), sample client application with multiple sensor types

**Structure Decision**: Single project architecture (Option 1) selected as this extends the existing HTM API service with additional cortical processing stages and a sample client application. The clean architecture pattern with ports/adapters is maintained while adding temporal memory, motor output, and complete pipeline orchestration components.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base for task structure
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design artifacts (data-model.md, contracts/*.md, quickstart.md)
- Create contract tests for each new API endpoint (temporal memory, motor output, pipeline)
- Generate domain model tasks for temporal memory and motor output entities
- Create integration tests for complete sensor-to-motor pipeline scenarios
- Implement sample client application with all four sensor types
- Follow existing HTM API patterns for consistency

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **TDD order**: Contract tests before implementation (all endpoints must have failing tests first)
- **Dependency order**: Domain models → Services → Handlers → Router integration
- **HTM sequence**: Temporal memory foundation → Motor output → Pipeline orchestration → Sample client
- **Component isolation**: Mark independent tasks with [P] for parallel execution
- **Validation progression**: Unit tests → Integration tests → Performance tests → End-to-end scenarios

**Task Categories Expected**:
1. **Contract Tests** (15-20 tasks): One test file per API endpoint from contracts/
2. **Domain Models** (8-12 tasks): Temporal memory, motor output, pipeline entities  
3. **Core Implementation** (20-25 tasks): Services, handlers, algorithms
4. **Sample Client** (10-15 tasks): Four sensor types, API integration, test scenarios
5. **Integration & Performance** (8-10 tasks): End-to-end tests, benchmarks, HTM compliance
6. **Documentation & Polish** (5-8 tasks): README updates, API documentation, deployment

**Estimated Output**: 65-90 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md with clear dependencies

**Key Dependencies Identified**:
- Temporal memory domain models must complete before temporal memory service
- Temporal memory service must complete before motor output (depends on predictions)
- Motor output must complete before complete pipeline orchestration
- All core HTM components must complete before sample client implementation
- Contract tests must exist and be failing before any implementation begins
- Integration tests depend on all component implementations being complete

**Parallel Execution Opportunities**:
- Contract test creation (all can be written simultaneously) [P]
- Domain model implementation (temporal memory and motor output independent) [P]  
- Sensor implementations in sample client (all four types independent) [P]
- Documentation tasks can proceed alongside implementation [P]

**Quality Gates**:
- All contract tests must fail initially (validates TDD approach)
- HTM compliance tests must pass throughout implementation
- Performance benchmarks must meet <100ms end-to-end target
- Sample client must demonstrate all sensor types successfully
- Complete pipeline must maintain 2-5% sparsity constraints

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
