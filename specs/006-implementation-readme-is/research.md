# Research: Complete HTM Pipeline with Sensor-to-Motor Integration

**Feature**: Complete HTM Pipeline Implementation  
**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 0 Complete

## Research Overview

This research phase analyzes the requirements for implementing a complete HTM (Hierarchical Temporal Memory) pipeline that extends the existing spatial pooler implementation to include temporal memory, motor output, and sensor-to-motor integration with a sample client application.

## Technical Decision Points

### 1. Temporal Memory Implementation Approach

**Decision**: Implement HTM temporal memory using sequence learning with cell-level processing  
**Rationale**: 
- HTM temporal memory requires cell-level sequence detection and prediction
- Existing spatial pooler produces column-level SDRs that need cell-level expansion
- Sequence learning enables pattern recognition across time steps
- Prediction capability is essential for motor output generation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple statistical sequence tracking: Rejected - insufficient for HTM biological fidelity
- RNN-based temporal processing: Rejected - violates HTM biological constraints
- External temporal memory library: Rejected - need custom HTM compliance

**Implementation details**:
- Cell activation states (active, predictive, winner cells)
- Synaptic connections between cells in different columns
- Temporal pooling for sequence consolidation
- Prediction confidence scoring for motor output decisions

### 2. Motor Output Architecture

**Decision**: Implement motor output as actionable command generation with feedback validation  
**Rationale**:
- Motor output must convert temporal memory predictions into concrete actions
- Feedback mechanisms validate action execution for learning
- Multiple output modalities support comprehensive testing
- Abstraction layer enables different actuator types

**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple prediction output: Rejected - insufficient for complete pipeline
- Direct hardware control: Rejected - too platform-specific for sample client
- Event-driven notifications: Rejected - lacks actionable response capability

**Implementation details**:
- Command generation from prediction patterns
- Action categorization (movement, audio, visual, control signals)
- Feedback collection and validation
- Performance metrics for action success rates

### 3. Sample Client Application Architecture

**Decision**: Standalone Go application with embedded sensors and HTM API integration  
**Rationale**:
- Independent client demonstrates real-world usage patterns
- Embedded sensors eliminate external dependencies for testing
- Go language consistency with HTM API simplifies integration
- Automated test scenarios enable validation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Web-based client: Rejected - adds complexity without HTM value
- Multiple language clients: Rejected - scope too large for sample
- Library-based integration: Rejected - doesn't demonstrate API usage

**Implementation details**:
- Four sensor types: temperature, text, image, audio
- HTTP client for HTM API communication
- Automated test scenario execution
- Real-time pipeline performance monitoring

### 4. Sensor Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Enhance existing sensor package with direct spatial pooler integration  
**Rationale**:
- Existing sensor encoders already produce compatible SDR outputs
- Direct integration eliminates manual SDR construction
- Maintains existing sensor API compatibility
- Enables seamless encoder → spatial pooler → temporal memory flow

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate sensor API: Rejected - creates unnecessary complexity
- Manual SDR construction: Rejected - violates ease-of-use requirements
- Sensor protocol redesign: Rejected - breaks existing functionality

**Implementation details**:
- Extend existing sensor endpoints with spatial pooler routing
- Automatic encoder output formatting for spatial pooler input
- Pipeline coordination between sensor processing and HTM stages
- Sensor health monitoring and error handling

## HTM Algorithm Research

### Temporal Memory Algorithm Requirements

Based on HTM theory research and Numenta publications:

1. **Cell-Level Processing**:
   - Each spatial pooler column contains multiple cells
   - Cells represent specific temporal contexts within spatial patterns
   - Winner cell selection based on temporal continuity

2. **Sequence Learning**:
   - Distal dendrite connections between cells in different columns
   - Temporal pooling to form stable sequence representations
   - Synaptic plasticity for sequence adaptation

3. **Prediction Generation**:
   - Predictive cell activation for anticipated patterns
   - Confidence scoring based on synaptic support
   - Multiple simultaneous predictions for motor output options

### Motor Output Research

Based on neuroscience literature and HTM motor cortex models:

1. **Command Generation**:
   - Pattern-to-action mapping from temporal memory predictions
   - Action selection based on prediction confidence
   - Multi-modal output support for comprehensive testing

2. **Feedback Integration**:
   - Success/failure feedback to temporal memory for learning
   - Performance metrics for continuous improvement
   - Error correction mechanisms for invalid actions

## Performance Requirements Research

### End-to-End Pipeline Latency

**Target**: <100ms sensor-to-motor processing  
**Breakdown**:
- Sensor encoding: <10ms
- Spatial pooling: <20ms (existing baseline)
- Temporal memory: <30ms (based on cell processing complexity)
- Motor output: <20ms (command generation + validation)
- Network overhead: <20ms (API communication)

### Concurrent Processing Capacity

**Target**: 25 concurrent sensors  
**Rationale**:
- Research-scale simulation requirements
- Adequate for multi-modal sensor testing
- Realistic load for single-server deployment

### Memory and Computational Requirements

**Spatial Pooler**: Already validated in existing implementation  
**Temporal Memory**: Estimated 2-3x spatial pooler memory for cell-level processing  
**Motor Output**: Minimal overhead, primarily computation-bound  
**Overall**: <500MB memory footprint for complete pipeline

## Integration Patterns Research

### API Design Patterns

**Decision**: RESTful endpoints with HTM-specific resource modeling  
**Endpoints identified**:
- `/api/v1/temporal-memory/process` - Temporal sequence processing
- `/api/v1/temporal-memory/config` - Temporal memory configuration
- `/api/v1/motor-output/process` - Motor command generation
- `/api/v1/motor-output/feedback` - Action result feedback
- `/api/v1/pipeline/process` - Complete sensor-to-motor processing

### Testing Strategy Research

**Decision**: Extend existing TDD approach with HTM-specific validation  
**Test categories**:
1. **Contract tests**: API endpoint compliance
2. **Integration tests**: Complete pipeline validation
3. **HTM compliance tests**: Biological constraint validation
4. **Performance tests**: Latency and throughput validation
5. **Sample client tests**: End-to-end user scenario validation

2. **Performance Scaling**: Multiple concurrent sensors may impact latency
   - **Mitigation**: Implement connection pooling and request queuing
   
3. **Integration Complexity**: Coordinating multiple HTM pipeline stages
   - **Mitigation**: Use existing clean architecture patterns with clear interfaces

### Implementation Risks

1. **Timeline Complexity**: Complete pipeline requires significant implementation
   - **Mitigation**: Leverage existing spatial pooler foundation and incremental development
   
2. **Testing Coverage**: HTM compliance requires specialized test scenarios

## Research Conclusions

The complete HTM pipeline implementation is technically feasible using the existing Go-based HTM API foundation. The research validates:
